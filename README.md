# What?

This is the source of my current portfolio site...unless I forgot to reuse this repo when I build a new one, in which case this is probably the source for an older version.

## Build instructions

all of this will eventually be wrapped up in a build tool, this is just for me as I'm building the site and deciding on a SSG to use.

* Build sass files
* That's it!
