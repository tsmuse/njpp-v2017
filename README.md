# What?

This is the source of my current portfolio site...unless I forgot to reuse this repo when I build a new one, in which case this is probably the source for an older version.

## Build instructions

* build Sass files *todo: move sass build into grunt*
* *npm install*  
* *grunt build*
* That's it!
