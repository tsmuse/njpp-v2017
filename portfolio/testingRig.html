<p>I was approached by Dr. Evans and Psychster in the spring of 2011 to design a tool that would allow Psychster to enhance it’s mobile usability testing practice. There were a number of solutions to this problem already, but none of them let Psychster’s analysts test a piece of usability software in a realistic way, all the existing camera rigs and slates interfered with the natural hand position of the phone, failed to capture the screen details clearly enough for accurate video analysis or completely removed the users hands form the image. The problem was simple to state but more complicated to solve: design a camera rig that allows a user to hold their phone naturally, without interruption from the test moderator, while capturing both the screen and the user’s hand motions clearly. </p>

	<b class="figcaption">a sketch of the second design for the rig. The first rig worked but was too top heavy to be easily held in one hand.</b>
</div>

<h2 id="learning-through-rapid-prototyping">Learning through rapid prototyping</h2>

<p>With a physical, three dimensional product, sketching in 2d only goes so far. After looking at existing solutions to this problem, doing some research into other camera mount designs, including crane and stedi-cam systems used in Hollywood, I began experimenting with different rig designs. Keeping in mind that the rig would most likely be in motion of some kind throughout recording, I knew the final design would have to compensate for that. Additionally the materials used couldn’t be too expensive, as the budget for the final prototype was relatively small and needed to include an HD camera. The first few prototypes effectively used the flex happening in the platform materials to counteract the shake of the camera, as the whole unit flexed it did so in a way that made kept the shot steady on the screen of the phone, as if it wasn’t moving at all. While the central problem was solved a new problem was discovered, the weight and balance of the rig were critical to natural use, and the weight of a modern smartphone was not enough to balance the materials used for the camera arm. Additionally, the use of an off the shelf 720p webcam created the problem of having the focus locked farther away from the lens of the camera, which meant the camera had to be positioned farther away from the screen to keep it in focus, but increasing the length of the arm increased the weight and balance problems…</p>

<h2 id="the-final-prototype">The final prototype</h2>

<p>New materials and a redesign of the neck, to one that was only flexible in the upper half, created a solution that was light and balanced enough to use comfortably as well as shake resistant enough to produce a crisp picture. Through the process the design of multiple platforms to allow for landscape and portrait orientation applications were also explored, but the sticky mat material was adherent enough that even a phone in landscape position on the platform held at almost 90 degrees stayed put. The additonal platforms weren’t needed. </p>

</div>

<h2 id="the-final-solution">The final solution</h2>

<p>The final prototype was used in multiple usability studies with Psychster clients with much success. Participants didn’t complain about having the rig in hand, and adjusted to it very quickly. In use, we discovered that the hands of the participants were actually very expressive and keeping them in the shot was very important. The web cam’s fixed focus forced us to pull the camera back and revealed this great new piece of data, without our attempts to improve on the designs others had already published we would have never discovered it. </p>

<p>In November 2011 Dr. Evans and I presented the camera rig solution as a poster at Microsoft’s World Usability Day conference. In the time since that presentation, it has become clear through an investigation of the marketplace that this product is simply too niche to mass produce profitably. There just isn’t a lot of demand for a camera mount to record the screen and hand movements of a mobile device outside the realm of research. Because of this realization, and because I believe having these tools will positively impact the testing and improvement of mobile devices and software in the future, I’m releasing the design into the public.
