<h2 id="there-are-approximately-two-billion-people-in-the-world-who-cant-afford-to-get-online">There are approximately two billion people in the world who can’t afford to get online</h2>

<p>The thing that drew me to Mozilla was the goal of the FirefoxOS project: to create a smartphone for the people who couldn’t afford to get on the web, not for the people for whom the Internet is a ubiquitous resource. The lower cost FirefoxOS phones were a great start, allowing people to get a smartphone with lower cost pre-paid service on sub-$100USD hardware. But for a large number of people on the planet, even a small reoccurring fee for service can be a burden. Sponsored FirefoxOS was an ecosystem project to help bring even more people onto the Internet by lowering the reoccurring cost of service to zero through brand sponsorship. </p>

	<b class="figcaption">“Brought to you by:” was a key philosphy. The most traditional ad in the phone is a small banner that disapears once a user starts dialing.</b>
</div>

<h2 id="not-the-advertising-phone">NOT the advertising phone</h2>

<p>When I started working on this project, my main objective was to make sure we didn’t end up putting ads all over the phone and end up making something people would hate. We didn’t have any actual sponsors at this phase, because we were pitching this idea to our carrier partners, and that freedom let us explore what kind of sponsorships could actually make the phone more fun than the non-sponsored versions while still fulfilling the marketing objectives any brand that signed on would have. These kinds of explorations would later guide discussions with partners about sponsors. </p>

</div>

<h2 id="sponsored-by-things-that-are-important-to-you">Sponsored by things that are important to you</h2>

<p>The World Cup was happening when we started this project and is a huge event in the parts of the world where this kind of service was most crucial, so we asked ourselves, “What would a sponsored phone that was all about fútbol be like? What would be be like right now during the world cup?” Adidas was the obvious choice, as the largest brand in soccer, to be our proposal. It’s important to point out that Adidas had nothing to do with this project, although I would love it if they would in the future.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="rapid-prototyping-rapid-uptake">Rapid prototyping, rapid uptake</h2>

<p>We jumped from sketches to prototype in about two days. Axure RP is a fantastic tool for FirefoxOS based prototypes, because the output is HTML/CSS/Javascript, which we could turn into a packaged FirefoxOS app and run on the actual handsets, and we could do so in a day. Actually seeing it running on a real phone, even though it wasn’t real at all, got our partners excited and they wanted to move forward with the process as quickly as we could. </p>

<h2 id="a-good-idea-has-legs">A good idea has legs</h2>

<p>Our goal with this project was to convince one of our telecom partners to roll this out on at least one of their regional brands. We got two. This concept is now working it’s way through the sales process to find sponsors to partner with us to create the apps and themes needed to make low cost Firefox OS phones come with free access to the web. We hope to see the first sponsored phones roll out in 2015.</p>
