<h2 id="life-as-a-ux-manager">Life as a “UX Manager”</h2>

<p>When I joined the UX group at Mozilla I had two goals, a product specific goal and a practice specific goal. For the product I wanted to change the industry’s definition of an app from something built for mobile devices with one of three sets of proprietary tools to something built for mobile devices using any of the tools we’ve used for the last fifteen years to make apps on the web. For Mozilla’s UX practice, I wanted to bring human-centered design into the culture at Mozilla and I was one of the large group of UX professionals who was hired to do just that. While we didn’t turn the world of mobile apps on its head, we did watch as Google embraced standards based web technology in the Play store, and we think we had some hand in that. On the process side, I brought the ideas of the user at the center to some of the most technical teams in the company, and we started making products that users really wanted and needed. </p>

<p>I was also fortunate enough to get to lead, mentor, and learn from a great design team where we all improved our craft as designers. While most of my job wasn’t making wireframes or prototypes or writing test plans, I provided direction, guidance, and critique for all the projects my team did. I worked with my designers to put in place processes that let us do more with less. I ran workshops with executives and other functional stakeholders to help define strategy and I spoke on behalf of the company about human-centered design and designing in open-source at: OsCon 2013, Firefox App Days 2013 in Warsaw, Mozilla UX Summit 2013 in London, UXPA Norfolk in 2014, and MozFest Brussels in 2014. </p>

<p>This case study is a little different than the rest. First, it represents a little over two years of design leadership work, a much larger scale project than any other in my portfolio. It also encompasses the work of my whole team, and while I had a hand in all of the projects the team did, I also want to give them the credit they deserve. What follows are two sections: The first is examples of design work the team did under my direction and the second is process improvements I brought to the team while I was running it. </p>

</div>

<h2 id="team-design-projects">Team Design Projects</h2>

<p>My role in all the projects we did was to push the designers to move past the obvious, insure quality, and provide whatever help the designers needed to get the work done. That ranged from running brainstorming sessions and critiques to pushing pixels when we were coming up on a tight deadline. These are a few of the projects the team did under my direction:</p>

<h2 id="process-improvements">Process Improvements</h2>

<p>I often tell people, “The team was my real design project for two and a half years” because that’s how I approached running it. My employees were my users, and the main thing I was there for was to give them what they needed to produce the best designs they could to get us to our goals. Most of the time that meant doing the traditional design director things: providing critique, asking lots of questions about the work, and helping them refine their pitches of the work. But the things that had the most impact were the processes I put in place to make the team more efficient, more creative, and let the designers focus on doing design work. Designing those processes is what I spent a lot of my “design time” working on. Here are the major processes I introduced to the team:</p>

<h3 id="a-regularly-scheduled-closed-critique-meeting">A regularly scheduled closed critique meeting</h3>

<p>When I started the team had twice weekly feedback sessions. These were usually attended by the design team, the product managers and some of the developers. Mozilla is a community driven, open-source project and a lot of the other groups in the company held public meetings to allow non-employee contributors to participate. We were the first design team to open up one of our review sessions to the public. It was a chance for people in the community to see what we were working on and get a chance to get involved if they saw something that interested in them, and it gave the team a chance to get feedback from a wider audience. While I opened one weekly meeting up to the public, I closed another to designers only (sometimes we had designers from other teams attend.) This meeting became our weekly critique meeting, which lead the team to produce better work and feel more confident in presenting that work. </p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/words-i-ve-said/critique-vs-feedback-knowing-the-difference-might-just-save-your-life-a6d2a3d9ce0d#.7plukbm58">I’ve written in more depth about the process if you would like more details.</a></p>

<h3 id="publishing-our-documentation-to-github">Publishing our documentation to Github</h3>

<p>All of our developers and community members were already on Github. All of the code for all of the company’s projects where there. It only made sense for us to start putting our work there so others could see it, and interact with it, the same way they did with the code for the software. This was not an easy process to implement, it required teaching git to a group of people who had never used it before, and it required me building a series of templates that met both the needs of the designers and the needs of the consumers of our work (the engineers, product managers, and community members.) The transition was well received by everyone involved and I only wish we had done it earlier. </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tsmuse/Firefox-Marketplace-UXSpecs-Templates">You can check out the templates and use or adapt them for your own work over on Github</a>  </p>

<h3 id="testing-as-part-of-the-design-process">Testing as part of the design process</h3>

<p>This is probably my proudest process accomplishment, because it was adopted by most of the other design teams in the company. I worked to bring in UserTesting.com and combine it with a series of test templates to let the designers quickly create and run methodologically sound usability studies, even if they had no experience designing or running usability tests. The speed that these tests could be finished was amazing, we would literally run them over lunch. In the first quarter of the program being in place we went from running 8 usability studies the previous quarter to running 74. When we started testing more, we had data to go along with our proposals and it ultimately made it easier to sell our ideas to the different stakeholders on projects. </p>
