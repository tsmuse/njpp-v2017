                    <h1 id="in-car-concierge-rd">In-car concierge R&amp;D</h1>

<p>The coolest thing about working on an early R&amp;D project, despite having to wait years to see your work in the real world, is that you get to work with technology that isn’t common place yet. In 2012 Heads Up Displays and Natural Language voice controls weren’t common. Touch screens hadn’t even truly started being “everywhere” yet. Siri was still more gimick than assistant. Google Now, Amazon’s Alexa, and Microsoft’s Cortana hadn’t been  released yet. Voice control was still mostly science fiction. When I was brought on to design this piece of a larger automotive initive, I was told to imagine and design a system that would feel common place in five years. Multiple displays and voice controls were what I saw in the car of 2017. </p>

<h2 id="the-two-ton-40mph-distraction-test">The “Two-ton 40mph distraction” test</h2>

<p>The biggest challenge of redesigning any system for any vehicle is making sure you don’t end up taking the user’s attention off of the cognitively taxing activity of piloting the vehicle. In this case, I came to describe this as the “Two-ton 40mph distraction” problem. Of all the fancy things we <em>could</em> put into the car, the last thing any of us wanted was to create a system that lead to people crashing. The only requirement on the system was that it had to pair with one or more smartphones, as long as it did that everything else was fair game. </p>

<p>Smartphones + drivers is already a dangerous combination, so I wanted to make sure what we put in would actually incentivize the driver to not look at her phone at all. I wanted the phone to disappear once the driver sat down. Traditional brainstorming led to a lot of lists and diagrams like the one above, which were helpful in defining all our options, but not so much in narrowing those options. I started writing short stories about drivers interacting with this system to help me narrow the possibilities. I wrote tens of stories about parents picking their kids up from school, 20somethings going on epic road trips, people making midnight runs to the grocery for ice cream or medicine or to cure insomnia. These stories helped me imagine all the reasons people drive and narrow down the interface elements that made the system useful while not distracting. </p>

<p>The final design centers around conversational voice controls, a windscreen projection display (aka a heads up display) for important information the driver needs, and a traditional central console display which can also be mirrored to passenger’s phones so they can more easily interact with things like maps and playlists. </p>

<h2 id="conversational-control-is-key">Conversational control is key</h2>

<p>It seems obvious today, but voice controlled in-car systems at the time required the users to memorize a list of commands the system could accept. If you didn’t say the right word, you got an error. I knew this would lead drivers to poke at the touch screen and take their eyes off the road, it was a non-starter. Natural language processing was one of the many technologies that were on the table for this system, so basically we got to make KITT from Knight Rider! To reduce distraction, or at least to keep distraction at it’s current levels, I wanted the driver to treat the system like a passenger in the car they were talking with. This is a task that most drivers have a lot of practice with. Because the system would be responding to things in and around the car it would mimic a conversation with a passenger more than someone on the other end of a phone call would, by interrupting if something important was going on. This meant the design of the UI wasn’t buttons, it was conversation rules and guidelines for the tone of voice the system would use. It had to be like a close friend, familiar in it’s tone of voice. Calling you by your first name when it really needed to get your attention, just saying what it wanted to say to you without any formalities the rest of the time. Speaking is at the heart of this design, and while it is certainly compatible with wheel controls or other tactile inputs, I designed it to be able to exist without those things. </p>

<h2 id="a-single-piece-of-an-elaborate-prototype">A single piece of an elaborate prototype</h2>

<p>The concierge was a small piece of a much larger connected car concept Intel was working on, and my final design was part of a larger prototype tested by the fantastic team in Intel’s Portland labs. As a consultant, I sadly didn’t get to see all the testing in action, or much of the other work other teams were doing. In the years that followed Intel has built many technologies for automotive systems on top of this initial work we did. You can see all of the them <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/automotive/automotive-overview.html">on their website</a>.</p>
